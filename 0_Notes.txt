Designing the data structure
1. Single line command
2. Single line form
3. Usercontrols for each block type (saved inside draggable objects)
4. Each form will have data properties that are both the same and some different

- I can have each form carry its own data
- Save it under Data
- Retrieve it with GetData

How do I save the data?
1. Update the Data property of each usercontrol when the single line diagram form closes
2. Store the draggable objects as json inside a sub folder in which the CAD is saved named "GMEP Saves/SLD"

When do I save the data?

Load Calculation Rundown
- A load calculation is an estimate of the total load that will be on a panel for a unit of that type
- Panels are named "P*unit type*" like P1 is panel of type Unit-1

1. General Lighting is 3VA * SQFT
2. Small appliance is 1500VA per counter recep, typically 2 for a kitchen and is typically 3000VA, if there is a kitchen and a bar far apart, then they could get 6000VA for this
3. Laundry is 1500VA
4. Bathroom 0VA unless asked, then 180VA * receps in bathrooms
5. Dishwasher is 1200VA per DW
6. Microwave is 1500VA per MW
7. Garbage disposal is 1200VA per GD
8. Bathroom Fans are 200VA * # of bathroom fans
9. Garage Door Opener is 1200VA * # of garage door openers
10. Dryer is 5000VA, if gas then 180VA
11. Range is 8000VA, if gas then 180VA
12. Refrigerator: 1000VA
13. Water Heater: 5000VA per WH, can be placed under General Load or under its own category if we want the panel to be larger

- Range is a stove top and an oven combined

Single line
- Transition section, what is it?
- Add tap section
- Add drip loop section

TODO
1. Disable Set XFMR Location when the XFMR is set to N/A or when Set Distribution Location has not been used
2. Change the backcolor of the ItemTab to Control
3. Add Distance from Distribution if no transformer, else add Distance from XFMR and Distance from XFMR to Distribution
4. Disable Set Breaker Item Location until Set Distribution Location is used
5. Add transition section block after asking residential about it
6. Add tap section
7. Add drip loop section
8. Update the forms of the other components to match the distribution form

TODO
1. Remove Load Calculation from type and have options for either "Panel Schedule" or "Load Calculation" when the user selects panel
2. Make the section for the distribution form slightly taller

Is there an advantage to using Blocks for everything that I create?
- Blocks can be updated in 1 section and repeat the change across the drawing
- Changing a value in the program could update the block instead and allow the user to not recreate and reposition the item

What work flow should the user have?
- Load calculations and panel schedules determine the size of the new services

What information is needed for a complete single line diagram to be made?
1. Number of distributions and their locations
2. On the distribution; the number of units, the unit type, and the unit location

TODO
1. Make a form where a user can fill out the different unit types

Load Calculations are done
- Per unit
- Per building (or service)
- Per meter section (or breaker off service)

1. Create Load Calculation program to fill out the loads for each unit


Unit Load Calculations
1. Show general lighting (3VA * sqft)
2. Show total general
3. Show subtotal general
4. Show total AC load
5. Show calculated load for service

TODO
1. Update the tab name based on the unit name (when the UNIT_NAME textbox value changes, update the tab name to "Unit *value in textbox*")
2. Default a 208V voltage type (the first option in the combobox)
3. Default the value in UNIT_NAME.Text to be equal to *number of tabs*
4. If the GAS_HEATER radio button is checked, change the value of WATER_HEATER_VA to 180.
5. If the ELECTRIC_HEATER radio button is checked, check if the WATER_HEATER_VA value is 180 and if so, change it to 5000.
6. If the GAS_DRYER radio button is checked, change the value of DRYER_VA to 180.
7. If the ELECTRIC_DRYER radio button is checked, check if the value of the DRYER_VA is 180 and if so, change it to 5000.
8. If the GAS_OVEN radio button is checked, change the value of OVEN_VA to 180.
9. If the ELECTRIC_OVEN radio button is checked, check if the value of OVEN_VA is 180 and if so, change it to 8000.
10. If the GAS_COOKTOP radio button is checked, change the value of COOKTOP_VA to 180.
11. If the ELECTRIC_COOKTOP radio button is checked, check if the value of COOKTOP_VA is 180 and if so, change it to 8000.
13. Add a total general load calculation label as a subtitle and a total general load calculation label as a value to update.
14. Add a subtotal general load calculation label as a subtitle and subtotal general load calculation label as a value to update.
15. Add a total AC load calculation label as a subtitle and a total AC load calculation label as a value to update.
16. Add a calculated load for service label as a subtitle and a calculated load for service label as a value to update.
